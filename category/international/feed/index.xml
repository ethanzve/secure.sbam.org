										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva said Wednesday that the US showdown over government debt was &#8220;unnecessary&#8221; for the world economy but a default could be avoided.</p>



<p>Georgieva and the head of Blackstone, one of the world&#8217;s biggest investment funds, expressed exasperation to the Qatar Economic Forum over the spending standoff between US President Joe Biden and opposition Republicans with an early June deadline looming.</p>



<p>International markets have become unnerved by the battle as some Republicans have questioned whether a quick agreement is necessary to avert a default.</p>



<p>&#8220;History tells us that the US wrestles with this notional default,&#8221; Georgieva said, referring to past US showdowns over spending limits.</p>



<p>&#8220;At the 11th hour, it gets resolved&#8221;.</p>



<p>But she added that the Washington drama was &#8220;unnecessary for a world economy that is in such high uncertainty&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;We always have to be mindful that the risk is there.&#8221;</p>



<p>Stephen Schwarzman, a major Republican donor, told the forum &#8220;it is a bit of a nail biter&#8221; and a battle of &#8220;wills and desires&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is somewhat difficult to imagine that this is actually going on,&#8221; said Schwarzman, chairman of Blackstone which manages more than $900 billion in assets around the world.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is a political standoff. I think the two parties are about $100 billion apart on freezing spending levels. I think that could be negotiated.</p>



<p>&#8220;The whole world is watching,&#8221; added the veteran tycoon who added that he too did not expect a default but could not predict when a solution would be found.</p>



<p>&#8220;If something were to happen &#8212; really as a miscalculation on the part of the people involved in the negotiations &#8212; I think it would hit domestic constituents in the US. It would put enormous pressure to have things resolved in a few days.&#8221;</p>



<p>The IMF chief also warned that interest rates would remain high around the world because of the threat from rising prices.</p>



<p>Georgieva said headline inflation in many countries was &#8220;peaking&#8221; because of central banks raising interest rates but &#8220;core inflation, primarily because of very stubborn food prices, is still not trimming down the way it should&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Central banks have to stay the course, because, if they move back on interest rates prematurely, then tension may become a problem for growth for a longer period of time,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>&#8220;Interest rates are high, they will stay high for longer, but we are expecting 2024, early 2025, the picture to change.&#8221;</p>
